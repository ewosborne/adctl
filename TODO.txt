service blocking cli


adctl service {block <name> |unblock <name> |listBlocked|listAll}

functions

blockService calls the POST endpoint to block a service
ditto unblockService (maybe same function with a toggle?)
listAllServices is a pretty basic thing I need anyways so keep it separate
listBlockedServices does what it says

same division: command -> print -> execute
