* parental, safesearch, safebrowsing support
* tests of all the blocking and unblocking.


* TUI?

* debug flag
* verbose - similar to debug.
* go over all method and data structure and command names and clean them up
* add a test for missing args on getlogs since that caused a crash
* 'adctl service update' with no parameters should do something or say something.



1. clean up all commands to conform to the structure like new ones - no passing args[] or cmd.
 * done.

2. tighten up cli keywords, make them clean and obvious.

new cli
noun verb
	filter*
		check**
	status*
		disable*
		enable*
		toggle*
    get*
	log  
		get << this seems vague >> **done anyways ***
	services*
	 'services' because this is not about stopping the whole service, it's about toggling specific web properties.
	 
	 what does the api call it?
	 
	 is there a better word than 'services" or 'service'?
		list*
			all*
			blocked*
		update*
			keep --block and --permit so I can do both at once?
			yeah, that seems cleaner


now todo: port over tests.

Commands represent actions, Args are things and Flags are modifiers for those actions.
The pattern to follow is APPNAME VERB NOUN --ADJECTIVE. or APPNAME COMMAND ARG --FLAG

    * logging and print to stderr if I need to do any?
    * clean up error formatting?
    * command names: case?  words?  verbs vs nouns?  'cmd noun verb' seems to be it.
    * exit codes? 0 on successful change, non-zero otherwise.
    * confirmation messages - oneliners that things worked or failed.
    * better help text - short and long.
    * url in help text
    * man page?  ick.  tools to generate it?
    * outputs other than json?  gron?  https://github.com/maahsome/gron
    * for flags, short and long versions.  
      * allow/block vs permit/deny?  
    * think real hard about when to have args over flags.  
    *   service permit/deny all with confirmation?  or just don't do this?  or just disable but not enable all?
    * what do 12factor apps do?
    * adjust timeout for network call?  60sec?  pass via flag?
    * dry run for changes? maybe just for service filters?
    * .config/adctl?  viper can do this?  
    * brew setup?
    https://github.com/fatih/color for color output support
    * list of services/IDs default to json but also have --table?
    * pre-action status reponses, e.g. "toggling adblock status" before toggle done.


3. tests
4. debugs and verbosity
5. general code tidiness.
