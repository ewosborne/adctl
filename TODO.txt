* parental, safesearch, safebrowsing support
* tests of all the blocking and unblocking.


* TUI?

* debug flag
* verbose - similar to debug.
* go over all method and data structure and command names and clean them up
* add a test for missing args on getlogs since that caused a crash
* output hooks for json, text, gron 


1. clean up all commands to conform to the structure like new ones - no passing args[] or cmd.
 * done.

2. tighten up cli keywords, make them clean and obvious. *done I think, maybe minor WIP

3. tests   *old ones ported over and work but I could always use more.

4. debugs and verbosity
  * global enableDebug flag defined, need to start using it
  x do not have verbosity yet, TBD.

5. general code tidiness.


    * clean up testAll/testCLI in justfile
    * use logging not printfs
    * change all printfs to json with flags for text and gron.
    * logging and print to stderr if I need to do any?
    * clean up error formatting?
    * command names: case?  words?  verbs vs nouns?  'cmd noun verb' seems to be it.
    * exit codes? 0 on successful change, non-zero otherwise.
    * confirmation messages - oneliners that things worked or failed.
    * better help text - short and long.
    * url in help text
    * man page?  ick.  tools to generate it?
    * outputs other than json?  gron?  https://github.com/maahsome/gron
    * for flags, short and long versions.  
      * allow/block vs permit/deny?  
    * think real hard about when to have args over flags.  
    *   service permit/deny all with confirmation?  or just don't do this?  or just disable but not enable all?
    * what do 12factor apps do?
    * adjust timeout for network call?  60sec?  pass via flag?
    * dry run for changes? maybe just for service filters?
    * .config/adctl?  viper can do this?  
    * brew setup?
    https://github.com/fatih/color for color output support
    * list of services/IDs default to json but also have --table?
    * pre-action status reponses, e.g. "toggling adblock status" before toggle done.
    * update README
